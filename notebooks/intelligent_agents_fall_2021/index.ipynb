    "we can describe an agent's behavior by the agent function.  \n",

    "Imagine an enivroment which only has two rooms (room A & room B). our agent is a vacumm cleaner. it can perceive wheter the room it is currently in, is dirty or not. it can also move beetwen the rooms and suck up dirt (the actuators of the agent).  \n",
    "Imagine that we only care about both rooms being clean, a simple way we can implement an agent that garantees this is for out agent to constanly move beetwen the rooms and suck up dirt in each one. Now imagine we also want to minimze the amount of energy the vcuum cleaner uses. In order to do that we can stop the agent for a limited amount of time if both rooms are clean. as you can see we implemented two compltly different agent for these two problems and thats because we used two different performance measure."

    "# Rational agents and performance measure\n",
    "a <b>rational</b> agent choose the set of action in order to maximize its performance. agents use a performance measure to evaluate the desirability of any given sequence. In other words an agent will choose the action (or a sequence of them) that maximize the expected value of its performance measure."

    "Keep in mind that rationality is distinct from omnniscience. an omniscience agent knows the actual outcome of its actions but in reality an agent only knows the expected outcome of its action.\n",
    "#### autonomy\n",
    "a rational agent should be autonomus meaning it musn't only rely on the prior knowledge of its designer and must learn to compensate for partial or incorrect prior knowledge. In other words rational agents should learn from expreince. for example in the vacumm world our agent could start to learn when the rooms usually get dirty based on its expreince."
